## New York

### Recommendations

* **museum**: [Frick Collection][frick]
    * FIVE STARS would go again. INCREDIBLE collection of art under one roof:
  Rembrandt, Degas, Renoir, Turner, Whistler, Velazquez, El Greco, Goya,
  Vermeer, Van Dyck...and like, FAMOUS paintings by all these people. It's
  a perfectly sized art museum -- when I went,
  took about 2.5 hours to "see" everything (although that was with two rooms
  closed), just the right amount before getting art fatigue. Excellent audio
  tour, so you can learn something about most of the pieces. Also very accessible -
  the collection is basically "things Henry Clay Frick liked and wanted to
  live with" so a lot of interesting portraits and landscapes. And it's in
  a beautiful house on 5th Ave.
* **food**: [Deb's New York Favorites][deb]
    * When I went to New York in Jan 2019 w/ my friend E., this was
    a big part of our trip because E is a big smitten kitchen fan. And Deb
    did not steer us wrong! We went to Barbuto, Breads Bakery, Ess-a-Bagel,
    Mimi Cheng's, Balthazar's, and Murray's Cheese Bar. Barbuto was AMAZING.
    Expensive, but so totally delicious and worth it.
* **outside**: Central Park
    * It's cliche, but...I love Central Park? I love the trees, the benches,
    the different moods (the ramble vs the more orderly southern bit,
    the big resevoir, the smaller lake, etc.).
* **outside**: Fort Tryon Park
* **outside**: High Line Park
* **sights** Rockefeller Center
    * The building is really lovely. And there's a Lego Store nearby.
* **church**: St. John the Divine
    * Okay, so this is mostly because I've read a lot of Madeleine L'Engle.
    I seem to recall an organ concert on Sunday afternoons, and morning/evening
    prayer services.
* **museum**: [Museum of Mathematics][momath]
    * A little pricey for the size of the museum. Aimed at late elementary
    to early middle school? But fun for adults too. :) Lots of interactive
    and hands-on exhibits.

## Philadelphia

### Recommendations

* **museum**: Benjamin Franklin Institute
    * Absolute favorite museum from my childhood! So many awesome exhibits,
    the big pendulum, a planetarium / Imax. The best.
* **museum**: Please Touch Museum
    * Lots of fond memories of going here as a kid and shopping, playing
    in the night kitchen, and being a newscaster.
* **food/shopping/sights**: Reading Terminal Market
    * A little bit of everything -- so many different little restaurants
    and shops.
* **sights**: Independence Hall
* **outside**: Longwood Gardens
    * This is one of my grandparents' favorites and mine as well. The grounds
    are extensive and beautiful if you want to go on a long outdoor walk. During
    the winter (or just because), the large greenhouses are nicely arranged
    and have specialty rooms for plants like orchids and succulents. There's
    also an amazing children's garden/play space with fountains and magical
    hidey-holes.
* **sights**: Herr's Factory Tour
    * I went on this a lonnnnng time ago, but remember it being super fun.
* **outside**: Valley Forge
    * Lots of family memories here -- hikes along the creek, hiding things
    in the old stone buildings in the forest, just walking around the area.

## Washington, DC

### Recommendations

* **church**: Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception
    * Absolute beauty of a church. The upper sanctuary is all mosaics, and
    HUGE. But I also love the lower chapel/church which has a great solemn,
    monastic feel while also being beautifully decorated.
* **sights**: National Zoo
    * It's a zoo. But it's free! I have a lovely memory of visiting my friend
    J., walking to the zoo together, and then spending almost half an hour
    just watching the elephants.
* **outside**: Rock Creek Park
* **museum**: Portrait Gallery
    * The portrait gallery is probably my favorite of the Smithsonian museums.
    The building is a great place to kill time, with an covered courtyard with
    fountains; the special exhibits are always great; the portraits are fun;
    and part of the building is the former patent office and is a beautiful
    art-deco type building.
* **museum**: Museum of American History / Museum of African American History
* **food**: [Jaleo][jaleo]
    * I still have very fond memories of the sangria and calamari.
* **sights**: Arlington
    * I still find the changing of the guard, and the tomb of the unkown soldier,
    a moving moment.
* **sights** National Mall
    * I love walking down the mall and all the sights you can see -- the
    Smithsonian castle, the museums, the Washington monument and WWII
    memorial, the reflecting pool and Lincoln memorial. Lincoln memorial
    and the Castle are probably my two favorites.
* **events**: Movies on the mall
    * The usual fun of outdoor movies but with the sun setting over the
    Washington Monument behindyou, and the Capitol lit up in front of you.
    I went to this with my housemates and we saw 12 Angry Men and I don't think
    you could ask for a better movie in that setting.
* **events**: Opera in the outfield
    * Sit in the outfield of Nats stadium and watch a simulcast of opening
    night of opera at the Kennedy Center. Super fun.
* **events/sights**: cherry blossoms on the tidal basin
    * Touristy? Yep. Crowded? Yep. Beautiful? Yep.
* **food**: [Busboys and Poets][busboys]
    * Local chain. I loved their sandwiches when I lived in DC.
* **outside/events**: Malcolm X (Meridian Hill) Park
    * Has a drumming circle on Sunday afternoons
* **outside**: favorite parts of the city
    * So many. Columbia Heights. Howard University. Logan
    Circle. Brookland. Le Droit Park. Mount Pleasant. Adams Morgan.
    Georgetown. U Street. Bloomington.
* **activities/events**: [50 states bike ride][fifty-states]
    * A route that touches all 50 of the "state streets" in DC. I've never
    done the whole thing (apparently it ends with a killer hill? is 62 miles
    long?) but did start it once and it was a lot of fun.
