INCREDIBLE collection of art under one roof: Rembrandt, Degas, Renoir, Turner, Whistler, Velazquez, El Greco, Goya, Vermeer, Van Dyck...and like, FAMOUS paintings by all these people. It's a perfectly sized art museum -- when I went, took about 2.5 hours to \"see\" everything (although that was with two rooms closed), just the right amount before getting art fatigue. Excellent audio tour, so you can learn something about most of the pieces. Also very accessible - the collection is basically \"things Henry Clay Frick liked and wanted to live with\" so a lot of interesting portraits and landscapes. And it's in a beautiful house on 5th Ave. food : Deb's New York Favorites When I went to New York in Jan 2019 w/ my friend E., this was a big part of our trip because E is a big smitten kitchen fan. And Deb did not steer us wrong! We went to Barbuto, Breads Bakery, Ess-a-Bagel, Mimi Cheng's, Balthazar's, and Murray's Cheese Bar. Barbuto was AMAZING. Expensive, but so totally delicious and worth it. outside : Central Park It's cliche, but...I love Central Park? I love the trees, the benches, the different moods (the ramble vs the more orderly southern bit, the big resevoir, the smaller lake, etc.). outside : Fort Tryon Park outside : High Line Park sights Rockefeller Center The building is really lovely. And there's a Lego Store nearby. church : St. John the Divine Okay, so this is mostly because I've read a lot of Madeleine L'Engle. I seem to recall an organ concert on Sunday afternoons, and morning/evening prayer services. museum : Museum of Mathematics A little pricey for the size of the museum. Aimed at late elementary to early middle school? But fun for adults too. :) Lots of interactive and hands-on exhibits.

The grounds are extensive and beautiful if you want to go on a long outdoor walk. During the winter (or just because), the large greenhouses are nicely arranged and have specialty rooms for plants like orchids and succulents. There's also an amazing children's garden/play space with fountains and magical hidey-holes. sights : Herr's Factory Tour I went on this a lonnnnng time ago, but remember it being super fun. outside : Valley Forge Lots of family memories here -- hikes along the creek, hiding things in the old stone buildings in the forest, just walking around the area.

But it's free! I have a lovely memory of visiting my friend J., walking to the zoo together, and then spending almost half an hour just watching the elephants. outside : Rock Creek Park museum : Portrait Gallery The portrait gallery is probably my favorite of the Smithsonian museums. The building is a great place to kill time, with an covered courtyard with fountains; the special exhibits are always great; the portraits are fun; and part of the building is the former patent office and is a beautiful art-deco type building. museum : Museum of American History / Museum of African American History food : Jaleo I still have very fond memories of the sangria and calamari. sights : Arlington I still find the changing of the guard, and the tomb of the unkown soldier, a moving moment. sights National Mall I love walking down the mall and all the sights you can see -- the Smithsonian castle, the museums, the Washington monument and WWII memorial, the reflecting pool and Lincoln memorial. Lincoln memorial and the Castle are probably my two favorites. events : Movies on the mall The usual fun of outdoor movies but with the sun setting over the Washington Monument behindyou, and the Capitol lit up in front of you. I went to this with my housemates and we saw 12 Angry Men and I don't think you could ask for a better movie in that setting. events : Opera in the outfield Sit in the outfield of Nats stadium and watch a simulcast of opening night of opera at the Kennedy Center.
