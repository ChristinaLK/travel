# Pacific Northwest

## Vancouver

### Recommendations

* **activities**: biking around the Stanley Park seawall. A classic for a
reason.
* **outside**: hikes on the north shore
    * Quarry Rock - old favorite from Regent days
    * Cleveland Dam/Capilano Canyon - beautiful view of the lions, great view
  of Grouse Mountain, nice short hike through forest / around the canyon. If you
  only have 1-2 hours to do something in North Van (not including transit), this
  is what I would recommend.
    * Brother's Creek - kind of hard to get to on transit (the last time
    I did this I hiked from Capilano Canyon to the hike, which I don't recommend, as it added
    elevation to an already climbing hike), but beautiful. Lots of trees,
    bridges over creeks, nice view of downtown from the trail head.
* **activities**: snowshoeing on Mt. Seymour. (winter)
    * Only did this once, as a
grad student, but it was fun.
