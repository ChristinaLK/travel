* **events/food**: Dane County Farmer's Market (summer)
    * Enormous farmer's market on Saturday mornings. More vegetable vendors
    than you could shake a stick at, but I usually buy flowers (most flower
    booths on the s.e. side of the square) and cheese -- my favorite is Bleu
    Mont Dairy (state st. corner). There's also a stand w/ really good donuts
    and in the spring, I get herbs and tomato plants from a few stands.
* **shopping**: Room of One's Own
    * Local, woman-owned, bookstore, with a feminist/queer/social-justice
    flair. Personable and wonderful. Also has a lot of cool cards!
* **food**: Med Cafe
    * On State Street, cash only, closed Mondays, the best Mediterranean food.
    Also get the tea. MMMMM.

    * Two words: Kang Gai. Savoury soup that is to die for.

    * A favorite of my work colleagues; they've shrunk their menu but have
    good tacos, enormous nachos and excellent tortas.
* **food**: Natty's fast food
    * Neighborhood spot, with super tasty chicken wings and other good
     Mexican options

    * Out in Middleton, but is my pick for best cheese curds in town
* **museum**: Mustard Museum
    * Only a 1-2 hour activity, but pretty fun.
* **events**: Madison Mallards
    * Summer college-level baseball league. All the schtick you could want
    from minor-league baseball, including t-shirt giveaways and the "beer
    batter" -- a player from the opposing team, who, if he strikes out, means
    that everyone gets 2 for 1 beers until the beginning of the next inning.
